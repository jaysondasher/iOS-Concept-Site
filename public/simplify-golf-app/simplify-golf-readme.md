## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 15 or later
- A Google Firebase account for using Firebase services like authentication and Firestore.

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simplify-golf.git
   cd simplify-golf
   ```

2. **Firebase Setup**

   This project uses Firebase for backend services. You need to create your own Firebase project and add the configuration to your Xcode project:

   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
   - Add an iOS app to your Firebase project and follow the setup instructions.
   - Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file.
   - Place the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file in the root of your Xcode project.
   - Note: The `GoogleService-Info.plist` file has been added to the `.gitignore` to protect sensitive information. You need to add your own file.

3. **Open the Xcode Project**

   Open the project in Xcode:

   ```bash
   open SimplifyGolf.xcodeproj
   ```

4. **Swift Package Dependencies**

   The project uses Swift Package Manager for dependencies. Xcode should automatically fetch the Firebase SDK. If it doesn't:
   
   - In Xcode, go to File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency
   - Enter the Firebase iOS SDK URL: https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk.git
   - Select the Firebase products you need (e.g., FirebaseAuth, FirebaseFirestore)

5. **Build and Run**

   Build the project and run it on a simulator or a real device.
